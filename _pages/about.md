I am S I Harini, currently in my final year at BITS Pilani, K.K. Birla Goa Campus, pursuing a BE in Computer Science with a minor in Data Science. My research interests encompass a broad spectrum, with a focus on Multi-modal Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Behavioral Science.

I did my undergraduate thesis at Autonomous Agents Lab, Stanford University under the supervision of Dr. Nick Haber where I worked on Iterative Generation of Single Player Games. Prior to this, I worked as a research intern at Adobe Media and Data Science Research, collaborating with Somesh Singh, Yaman Kumar and Balaji Krishnamurthy on the Long-Term Memorability of Advertisements.

At BITS, I've had the privilege of working on Neuro Symbolic Learning problems with Dr. Ashwin Srinivisan and Dr. Aditya Challa from APPCAIR and Dr. Gautam Shroff from TCS Research. Additionally, I collaborated with Dr. Swati Agarwal on AI4Code projects as a part of the CLSNet Lab.

Beyond this, I am also an active member of the Society for Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning (SAiDL) at BITS Goa. This involvement allows me to regularly participate in collaborative projects and mentor fellow students.
