# Hi! 👋

I am **S. I. Harini**, a Software Engineer at **Adobe**. I graduated from **BITS Pilani, K.K. Birla Goa Campus**, with a **Bachelor of Engineering** in **Computer Science** and a minor in **Data Science**.

My research interests broadly lie in **Multimodal Machine Learning** and **Natural Language Processing**. During my undergraduate studies, I completed my thesis at the **Autonomous Agents Lab, Stanford University**, under the supervision of **Dr. Nick Haber**, where I focused on generating simulations to train intelligent agents.

Before my current role at Adobe, I interned at the **Adobe Media and Data Science Research Lab**, where I worked with **Somesh Singh** and **Yaman Kumar** on predicting and modeling different types of behavior in response to given types of content using large language models (LLMs).

At **BITS**, I had the opportunity to work on **Neuro-Symbolic Learning** problems with **Dr. Ashwin Srinivasan** and **Dr. Gautam Shroff** from **TCS Research**. I also collaborated with **Dr. Swati Agarwal** on **AI4Code** projects as part of the **CLSNet Lab**.

I am an active member of the **Society for Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning (SAiDL)** at **BITS Goa**, where I participate in collaborative projects and mentor fellow students.
