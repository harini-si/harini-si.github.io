I was a teaching assistant to Prof. Neena Goveas for the course Object Oriented Programming (CS F213) at BITS. I was responsible for conducting lab sessions, grading assignments and exams, and helping students with their doubts. The course is a 3 credit compulsory course taken by all second year students of the Computer Science department.
