I was the teaching assistant to Gautam Shroff, Prof. Tanmay for the graded course BITS F441: Meta Learning, conducted by BITS, IIT Delhi, and IIIT Delhi. I conducted Homeworks and Quizzes as a part of the course. I was also responsible for conducting lab sessions, grading assignments and exams, and helping students with their doubts.
