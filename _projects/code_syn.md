Built a preliminary model for code search with a simple encoder-decoder architecture that computes the cosine similarity of the embeddings for searching. Additionally, fine-tuned the CodeBERT model specifically for Code Search on C/C++. Moreover, trained and fine-tuned a code clone detection model across multiple languages such as Python, Java, C/C++ for detecting plagiarized code.
