The project aimed to address the IPARC Challenge, resembling ARC but with defined background knowledge. My initial attempts involved applying various search methods, such as exhaustive search, greedy search, beam search, and A* search, to Category A simple tasks. Despite experimenting with different similarity metrics for heuristics, the high search space led to poor performance. Subsequently, I used dreamcoder along with inductive logic for solving these tasks . Initially achieving an 11 out of 20 success rate, the model's performance improved to 15 out of 20 tasks (75% success rate) after experimenting with input pairs and triplets.
